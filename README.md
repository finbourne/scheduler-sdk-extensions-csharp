These are the C# SDK Extensions (Preview) to accompany the [C# SDK (Preview) for the Scheduler application](https://github.com/finbourne/scheduler-sdk-csharp-preview). The Scheduler application provides automated job scheduling functionality.

This extensions package provides the user with additional extensions to make it easy to configure and use the API endpoints. This repository contains examples of how to use these additional extensions in the Finbourne.Scheduler.Sdk.Extensions.Tutorials project.

The Scheduler application is part of the [LUSID by FINBOURNE](https://www.finbourne.com/lusid-technology) platform. To use it you'll need a LUSID account. [Sign up for free at lusid.com](https://www.lusid.com/app/signup).
